# moneymoney-kucoin
Fetches balances from KuCoin API and returns them as securities.

Uses cryptocompare.com API to convert prices into EUR.

**Important:**
***Not working at the moment due to the API upgrade.***
There is a [`v2` branch](https://github.com/lukasbesch/moneymoney-kucoin/blob/api-v2/kucoin.lua#L150-L176) in development.

## Extension Setup

Download and move `kucoin.lua` to your MoneyMoney Extensions folder.

Add a new account (type "KuCoin Account") and use your API key as username and your API secret as password.

You need to use a beta version of MoneyMoney because this extension is not signed yet.
